Jaroslav Čech originally from Slovakia is an artist, who devotes himself to free art. He started with landscape painting, later he found inspiration in figuration, then abstraction. These three pillars are connected with a deep inner experience of life and this principle is still present and valid in his creation. In recent years the artist has devoted himself to realisations in interiors. These are wall paintings and reliefs made in coating. The artist has always enjoyed experimenting with various art techniques, and it is the experience from the interiors that has led to the emergence of a distinctive artistic expression. In retrospect, he transferred this experience from interiors to his work on portable surfaces such as boards, painting canvases and thus the idea of portable walls was born.

                        The artist says: "I brought my work to the paintings and reliefs on the walls and I transferred and applied the subsequent experience to mobile walls = to portable surfaces."

                      The moving walls is part of the All AT Wall project, which focuses on painting and coloured relief directly on the wall. The author's intention is to create a decorative element that aligns with the already existing interior elements of interior design and architecture in order to harmonise, calm the space and sweep it into a space that is basically usable for users. 
                                             
                       The walls are solid, large, stationary surfaces, but it is interesting to think about them differently. Play with the concept or idea, that you can simply take the wall with you. Such a work can then be easily moved away and transferred elsewhere - take it with you. This is how the idea of portable walls came about - and the technique of creating this work was adapted to a portable base. 
                        

                    
                       These are therefore portable works of various sizes using a technique reminiscent of wall creation. A wall is something that is solid, static and in one place. In the modern mobile world the wall can move and at the same time being a work of art. It is wonderful to remember the power that a person has through imagination, when we can move with things that we cannot normally move - a game of mind and perception.

The themes and colour design is created on the basis of individual clear, sometimes even distinct requirements of the client. Sometimes they arise in such a way that the clients want to change the interior and has no idea how they would like to change the walls. Then the artist designs, present and consult a suitable solution for changing the interior while taking into account the requirement of mobility of the work. The works are not perceived as a design element or as a decoration, but as an individual work of art that has an original idea.
